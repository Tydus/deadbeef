1. compiling, dependencies, etc

* first you need to install dependencies. full list is provided at the end of this section for your convenience

* you will need intltool to be installed. if you don't need translations -- run ./configure --disable-nls (in this case you won't need to install intltool)

* if you want to build from git - install autotools, and run ./autogen.sh to bootstrap

* run "./configure --help", and read it.

* now you're ready to configure the build process -- run "./configure --prefix=/usr", and wait until it finishes. you may want to change prefix to another value. consult INSTALL file for more info.

* make sure all plugins which you want have "Yes" status in the list that's printed by configure. if not -- install missing dependencies, and rerun configure. that is especially important for GTKUI, and ALSA or OSS plugins. make sure you have both. otherwise you won't get GUI and/or sound output.

* after satisfying all dependencies, run "make -j5" (change -j number to suit your number of CPUs/cores, e.g. 5 is quite good for single CPU dual-core machines). it is a good idea to do it as normal user (this step doesn't require root privileges).

* after build finishes, run "make install" as root
